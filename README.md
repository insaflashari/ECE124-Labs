# LAB 3: Energy Monitoring & HVAC FPGA Project
This project demonstrates a complete digital energy monitoring and HVAC control system designed and implemented in VHDL. The system integrates multiple modules:

Temperature Monitoring: Uses multi-bit comparators to compare current and target temperatures.

Control Logic: Automatically manages HVAC operation, including furnace, AC, blower, and vacation mode logic.

User Inputs: Window and door sensors affect system operation for energy efficiency.

Display Interface: 7-segment display drivers and bit-shifters provide real-time feedback.

Simulation & Testing: Testbench frameworks ensure correct functionality for all modules.

This project demonstrates expertise in FPGA development and VHDL programming, showcasing modular digital design, sequential logic, and hardware simulation. It’s an excellent example of applied embedded systems and hardware engineering skills.
